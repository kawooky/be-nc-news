---Summary of my project: This project was created during my time on the NorthCoders boot-camp. This website is an example of a social news website and forum where content is socially curated and promoted by site members through voting. Features of the app include adding a comment to an article, voting up or down, filtering articles and selecting a user.


---Instructions if you wish to run this project locally:
-How to clone: git clone https://github.com/kawooky/fe-nc-news.git
-How to install dependencies: npm install
-How to seed local database: npm run seed
-How to run the tests: npm run test

-How to create the environment variables files:

Create a file called .env.development
Within this file add the text 'PGDATABASE=nc_news'

Then create a file called .env.test
Within this file add the text 'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test'

This connects us to the desired database for each environment.
