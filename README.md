Instructions on how to create the environment variables if you wish to run this project locally:

Create a file called .env.development
Within this file add the text 'PGDATABASE=nc_news'

Then create a file called .env.test
Within this file add the text 'PGDATABASE=nc_news_test'

This connects us to the desired database for each environment.
